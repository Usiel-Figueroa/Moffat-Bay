# Moffat Bay Lodge Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of **CSD 460 Capstone in Software Development**.  
The goal of the project is to simulate an online resort reservation system for **Moffat Bay Lodge** on Joviedsa Island, Washington State.  

The application allows users to:
- Explore **About Us** and **Attractions** pages.
- **Register** for a free account.
- **Log in** securely with password hashing.
- **Book rooms** (with live preview and dynamic pricing).
- **Review reservation details** on the Summary page.
- **Lookup past reservations** by reservation ID or email address.
- **Cancel or confirm reservations** before saving to the database.

All data is stored in a **MySQL database** and accessed via **JSP pages with JDBC (DBUtil helper class)**.
