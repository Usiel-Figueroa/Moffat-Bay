Purpose of Website Project:
Customers can view all aspects of the Lodge website without being logged in. 
To book their vacation (lodge reservation), they must be logged in/registered. 
In other words, to submit a reservation, prompt users to log in or register for a free account. 
There are no requirements for payment, but users must “click” a button to confirm their reservation. 
Once a reservation is confirmed, send the record to the database for insertion. 
The reservations you save in the database will be used to populate the Reservation Lookup page. 
All registered users should be saved to a table in the database. This table will be used during the 
login process to validate their access.

      <h2>About Moffat Bay Lodge</h2>
      <p>
        Nestled along the pristine shores of Joviedsa Island in Washington State, 
        <strong>Moffat Bay Lodge</strong> is a premier waterfront retreat designed 
        to showcase the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the San Juan Islands. 
        Just six months ago, the San Juan Islands First Nations Development Committee 
        approved the vision for a world-class resort at Moffat Bay, bringing together 
        traditional stewardship of the land with modern guest experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Construction of the lodge is now nearing completion, with the goal of creating 
        a sanctuary where guests can relax, recharge, and connect with nature. 
        Surrounded by breathtaking views of the Pacific Northwest, the resort offers 
        thoughtfully designed accommodations, locally inspired dining, and a host of 
        activities that celebrate the island’s unique character. 
      </p>

      <p>
        At Moffat Bay Lodge, our mission is to provide more than just a vacation — 
        we deliver a meaningful escape. Guests can look forward to evenings by the 
        water, guided cultural experiences, and unparalleled hospitality that reflects 
        the spirit of the island. Whether you are seeking tranquility, adventure, 
        or a bit of both, Moffat Bay Lodge promises an unforgettable stay.
